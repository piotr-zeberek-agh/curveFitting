# Curve Fitting Project
Polynomial regression using ordinary least square estimation.

## Work status
Program works well but utilizes naive algorithms for matrix multiplication, transposition and so on.

## Possible future additions
* Reading (x,y) pairs from data file. (fairly easy)
* Integrating tiled algorithms. (harder)
* Rewriting code for cpu for comparison purposes. (quite hard time consuming)
