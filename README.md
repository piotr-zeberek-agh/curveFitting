# Curve Fitting Project
Polynomial regression using ordinary least square estimation.

## Work status
Program works well but utilizes naive algorithms for matrix multiplication, transposition and so on.

## Possible future additions
* [DONE] Reading (x,y) pairs from data file. (fairly easy)
* Integrating tiled algorithms. (harder)
* Rewriting code as a cpu version for comparison purposes. (quite hard and time consuming)
